# Drawbacks of Waterfall Model in Software Engineering

The Waterfall model is a traditional Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) model
that follows a sequential approach. While simple, it has several limitations.

## 🔍 Key Drawbacks

1. Rigid and inflexible structure
2. Difficult to handle changing requirements
3. Testing happens very late
4. High risk and uncertainty
5. Limited customer involvement
6. No early working software
7. Not suitable for large or complex projects

---

## ❌ Why Waterfall Often Fails

- Requirements are assumed to be fixed
- Errors discovered late are costly
- Customer feedback is delayed
- No iteration or improvement during development

## 📊 Waterfall vs Agile

| Feature | Waterfall | Agile |
|-------|----------|-------|
| Flexibility | Low | High |
| Customer Feedback | Late | Continuous |
| Testing | After development | Continuous |
| Delivery | End of project | Incremental |

## 📌 Conclusion

Due to its rigidity and lack of adaptability, the Waterfall model is rarely used
in modern software development where requirements change frequently.
