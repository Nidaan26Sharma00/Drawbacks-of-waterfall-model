# Waterfall Model Drawbacks in Software Engineering

This repository explains the **drawbacks and limitations** of the traditional Waterfall model in software development.

---

## 📌 What Is the Waterfall Model?

The *Waterfall model* is a classical **software development life cycle (SDLC)** model that follows a strictly sequential approach:  
1. Requirement Gathering  
2. Design  
3. Implementation  
4. Testing  
5. Deployment/Delivery  
6. Maintenance :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

The idea is that each phase must be completed before the next one begins, with minimal overlap.

## ⚠️ Major Drawbacks

### 1. **Inflexible and Rigid Workflow**
Once a phase is completed, it’s **very difficult to go back** and make changes without affecting the entire project timeline. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### 2. **Difficulty Handling Changes**
The model assumes all requirements are known at the start. In real projects, requirements often change — but Waterfall doesn’t easily support changing requirements. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 3. **Late Testing and Feedback**
Testing happens after implementation. If major problems are discovered late, fixing them is costly and time-consuming. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

### 4. **Limited Stakeholder Involvement**
Customers and end-users typically provide input only at the beginning and end of development, which can result in a final product that doesn’t meet expectations. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

### 5. **No Incremental Delivery**
The product is delivered at the end of the cycle only — there’s no early or staged delivery of features. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

### 6. **Poor Adaptability for Large, Complex Projects**
Because of its rigid nature and lack of feedback, Waterfall doesn’t scale well to projects where requirements may evolve. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## 📊 Comparison with Agile

| Feature | Waterfall | Agile |
|---------|-----------|-------|
| Flexibility | Low | High |
| Feedback | Late | Continuous |
| Delivery | End of project | Incremental |
| Requirement changes | Difficult | Easy |
